## Descriptions pages
On my website, there are two main pages: the Home page and the Catalog page. The Home page introduces visitors to the camper rental service, while the Catalog page offers a complete listing of available campers. Here, users can apply filters to refine their search. Additionally, there is a modal that allows users to view more detailed information about the selected campers.
